I am building a React/TypeScript application using React Query and Axios (api). I want to see how to properly import my api instance, and then use useQuery for GET requests and useMutation for POST/PUT/DELETE requests. The example should show how to:

Fetch data with useQuery (GET) including error handling, retries, and caching options.

Mutate data with useMutation (POST/PUT/DELETE) including success and error handling.

Show where to import api and how to use its .get(), .post(), .put(), .delete() methods.
